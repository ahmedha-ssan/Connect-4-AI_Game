# Connect-4-Project
=> Implementation Connect 4 game with the minimax and alpha-beta pruning algorithms.
=> This project allowed us to explore the field of artificial intelligence and gain practical experience in developing game-playing agents that can make optimal            decisions.
✅ Implemented the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning for optimal decision-making.
✅ Utilized the Pygame library for creating an interactive and visually appealing game interface.
✅ Supports different difficulty levels, allowing players to choose from easy, medium, and hard modes.
✅ Displays real-time feedback and game status updates for an immersive gameplay experience.
✅ AI vs. computer gameplay.
